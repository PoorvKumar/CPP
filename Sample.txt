and calling parammeterised constructor of class ofstream
ofstream outfile(Sample.txt); -> where other parameter is default parameter
which can be ios::trunc(default)->to truncate(remove contents from original file)
or ios::app (append)-> to append new data to original data of file
new text appended to Sample.txt by constructing another object of type class ofstream and opening Sample.txt in ios::app mode
